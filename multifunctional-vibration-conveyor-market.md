<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifunctional Vibration Conveyor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Frequency Types</li><li>Forced Vibration Types</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multifunctional vibration conveyors can be classified into two main types based on their operating mechanisms. Natural frequency types operate at the system's natural frequency, allowing for efficient material conveying. Forced vibration types, on the other hand, utilize external forces or vibrations to move materials along the conveyor. Both types offer unique benefits and are suited for different applications, with natural frequency types excelling in handling delicate materials and forced vibration types being more versatile in handling various kinds of materials.</p></p>
