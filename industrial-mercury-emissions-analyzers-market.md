<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Mercury Emissions Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption</li><li>Cold Atomic Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial Mercury Emissions Analyzers are crucial for monitoring mercury levels in industrial emissions. Two popular types in the market are Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA) and Cold Atomic Fluorescence (CAF). CVAA analyzers measure mercury levels by converting elemental mercury to vapor and then detecting absorbance at a specific wavelength. CAF analyzers utilize fluorescence to detect mercury levels by exciting the atoms with light and measuring the emitted fluorescence. Both types are effective in accurately measuring mercury emissions in industrial settings.</p></p>
