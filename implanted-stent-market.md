<p><h1>Implanted Stent Market Share & Market New Trends Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Implanted Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>An implanted stent is a small mesh tube placed in a blood vessel or artery to help improve blood flow. It is commonly used to treat conditions such as coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and narrowing of the arteries. The stent helps to keep the artery open and prevent it from becoming blocked.</p><p>The implanted stent market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in stent technology, and rising geriatric population. Additionally, growing awareness about minimally invasive procedures and preference for stents over traditional open-heart surgeries are also driving market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the implanted stent market is the development of bioresorbable stents. These stents are designed to dissolve over time, reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional metal stents. Other trends include the use of drug-eluting stents to prevent restenosis, and the integration of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve stent design and placement.</p><p>Overall, the implanted stent market is expected to continue growing as technological advancements and research efforts drive innovation in stent design and treatment options for patients with cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>
