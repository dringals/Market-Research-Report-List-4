<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Transverse Thrusters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Fixed Pitch Propeller</li><li>With Controllable Pitch Propeller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine transverse thrusters are used to provide propulsion and maneuverability to ships. There are two main types of marine transverse thrusters - those with fixed pitch propellers and those with controllable pitch propellers. Thrusters with fixed pitch propellers have a constant blade angle and are typically more cost-effective. On the other hand, thrusters with controllable pitch propellers allow for more precise control and efficiency in different operating conditions. Both types play a crucial role in improving the handling and maneuverability of ships.</p></p>
