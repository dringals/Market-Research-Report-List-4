<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Toxicity Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionizing Radiation</li><li>Non-ionizing Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation toxicity treatment market is divided into two main types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation includes high-energy particles and electromagnetic waves that have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, leading to potential harm to human tissues. Non-ionizing radiation, on the other hand, has lower energy levels and does not have enough power to remove electrons from atoms, but still poses health risks over prolonged exposure. Both types require specialized treatments and precautions to minimize their toxic effects on the body.</p></p>
