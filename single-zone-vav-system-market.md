<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Zone VAV System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Duct</li><li>Dual-Duct</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Zone VAV Systems are commonly categorized into two market types: Single-Duct and Dual-Duct. In Single-Duct systems, a single supply air duct carries both heated and cooled air to the zone, and a mixing box controls the temperature. On the other hand, Dual-Duct systems use two separate ducts to deliver hot and cold air to the zone, allowing for more precise temperature control. Both types of systems offer energy efficiency and flexibility in regulating air flow to different zones within a building.</p></p>
