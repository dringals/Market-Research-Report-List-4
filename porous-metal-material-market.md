<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Porous Metal Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Hole Type</li><li>Continuous Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Porous metal materials can be categorized into two main types based on the structure of the holes within the material: independent hole type and continuous hole type. Independent hole type porous metals have separate and distinct holes that are not interconnected, allowing for a more controlled flow of liquids or gases. In contrast, continuous hole type porous metals feature interconnected holes that enable a more uniform distribution of fluids throughout the material. Each type of porous metal material has different applications and advantages based on their hole structure.</p></p>
