<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthopedic Pins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable</li><li>Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orthopedic pins are used in surgeries to fix fractures or provide stability to bones. Non-absorbable pins are made of materials like stainless steel or titanium, and are not designed to be absorbed by the body. They are often used for long-term fixation. Absorbable pins, on the other hand, are made of materials like bioabsorbable polymers that gradually dissolve in the body over time. They are typically used for temporary stabilization and do not require a second surgery for removal. Both types play a vital role in orthopedic procedures.</p></p>
