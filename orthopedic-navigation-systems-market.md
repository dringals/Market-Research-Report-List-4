<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthopedic Navigation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CT-Free Navigation Systems</li><li>Image-Free Navigation Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orthopedic Navigation Systems help surgeons perform precise and accurate procedures by providing real-time guidance during surgery. There are two main types of navigation systems: CT-Free Navigation Systems and Image-Free Navigation Systems. CT-Free Navigation Systems use preoperative images and sensors to track the position of surgical tools and implants. On the other hand, Image-Free Navigation Systems rely on intraoperative sensors and instruments to guide the surgeon without the need for preoperative imaging. Both systems offer advanced technology to improve surgical outcomes in orthopedic procedures.</p></p>
