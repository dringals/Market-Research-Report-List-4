<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural tractor tires market comprises two main types - radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are designed with a sidewall that is perpendicular to the tread, leading to better grip, stability, and fuel efficiency. They are also known for providing a comfortable ride. On the other hand, bias tires have crisscrossing layers of ply cords under the tread, making them more durable and suitable for heavy-duty operations. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific needs of the agricultural operation.</p></p>
