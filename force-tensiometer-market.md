<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Force Tensiometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Fully Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Force tensiometers are laboratory instruments used to measure the surface tension and contact angle of liquids. There are two main types in the market - semi-automatic and fully automatic. Semi-automatic force tensiometers require some manual intervention from the user, such as adjusting parameters or initiating measurements. On the other hand, fully automatic force tensiometers do not require any manual intervention as they are capable of performing tests and generating results automatically. Both types offer high accuracy and reliability in measuring surface properties of liquids.</p></p>
