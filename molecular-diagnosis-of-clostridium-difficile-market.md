<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molecular Diagnosis of Clostridium Difficile Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sensitivity Above 90%</li><li>Sensitivity Below 90%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Molecular diagnosis of Clostridium difficile with sensitivity above 90% is considered highly accurate and reliable for detecting the presence of the bacteria in patient samples. This type of test is preferred for its high level of sensitivity, which ensures that true positive cases are rarely missed. On the other hand, molecular tests with sensitivity below 90% may be less accurate and can sometimes yield false negative results, leading to potential misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. Healthcare providers may choose tests based on their specific diagnostic needs and the level of accuracy required.</p></p>
