<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Propulsion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Breathing</li><li>Non-Air Breathing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aviation propulsion systems can be categorized into two main types: air-breathing and non-air breathing. Air-breathing propulsion systems rely on taking in air from the surrounding environment to generate thrust, which includes turbofan, turboprop, and ramjet engines. On the other hand, non-air breathing propulsion systems do not require air intake and typically use materials like liquid propellants or solid rocket fuels to generate thrust, such as rocket engines. Both types play a crucial role in powering different types of aircraft and spacecraft.</p></p>
