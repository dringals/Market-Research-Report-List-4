<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Resistance Backflow Preventer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Diaphragm</li><li>Single Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low resistance backflow preventers are common in two main types: double diaphragm and single diaphragm. Double diaphragm backflow preventers have two flexible diaphragms that help to regulate and control the flow of water, reducing the risk of contamination. On the other hand, single diaphragm backflow preventers only have one diaphragm, but still offer effective protection against backflow. Both types are essential in preventing water from flowing in the wrong direction, ensuring clean and safe water distribution.</p></p>
