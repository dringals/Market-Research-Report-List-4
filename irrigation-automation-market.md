<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Irrigation Automation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic</li><li>Semiautomatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Irrigation automation can be categorized into two main types â€“ fully automatic and semiautomatic. Fully automatic irrigation systems are equipped with sensors and timers that regulate watering based on specific criteria such as soil moisture levels or weather conditions. This type of system requires minimal human intervention once set up. On the other hand, semiautomatic systems still require some manual input from the user, such as adjusting settings or turning the system on and off, but they also offer some level of automation in controlling water flow.</p></p>
