<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Cleaners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist (PR) Strippers</li><li>Negative Photoresist (PR) Strippers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist cleaners are chemicals used to remove photoresist residue from surfaces after photolithography processes. Positive photoresist (PR) strippers are designed to remove positive photoresist material from substrates, while negative photoresist (PR) strippers are formulated to remove negative photoresist material. Positive PR strippers work by breaking down the photoresist material so it can be easily rinsed away, while negative PR strippers dissolve the negative photoresist material to clean the surface. Both types of photoresist cleaners play a crucial role in the semiconductor and electronics industry.</p></p>
