<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sample Rate Converter ICs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asynchronous Type</li><li>Synchronous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sample Rate Converter ICs are categorized into two main types: Asynchronous Type and Synchronous Type. Asynchronous Type converters operate independently of the input clock signal, making them more flexible in handling various input frequencies. On the other hand, Synchronous Type converters operate based on the input clock signal, providing better accuracy and lower jitter performance. Asynchronous Type converters are preferred in applications where flexibility is essential, while Synchronous Type converters are ideal for applications where precise synchronization is required.</p></p>
