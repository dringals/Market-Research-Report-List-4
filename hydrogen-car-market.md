<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HICEV</li><li>Fuel Cell Vehicle-FCEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogen car market consists of two main types of vehicles - Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (HICEV) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV). HICEVs work by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine to generate power, similar to traditional gasoline cars. On the other hand, FCEVs use hydrogen fuel cells to produce electricity, which powers an electric motor. Both types of vehicles are considered environmentally friendly as they emit only water vapor, but FCEVs are seen as more advanced and efficient in the long run.</p></p>
