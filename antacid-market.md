<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antacid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proton Pump Inhibitor</li><li>H2 Antagonist</li><li>Acid Neutralizers</li></ul></p>

PPIs work by blocking the production of acid in the stomach, providing long-lasting relief from heartburn and acid reflux. H2 Antagonists also reduce stomach acid production but are not as potent as PPIs. Acid Neutralizers, such as calcium carbonate, work by directly neutralizing stomach acid. Each type of antacid has its own unique mechanism of action and is used to treat various digestive issues.</p></p>
